# 100 blocks a day app

A JS tool to visually structure your day (for more happiness and productivity)

I liked this post on [100 blocks a day](http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/100-blocks-day.html), because 100 is a good number and also ðŸ˜´.
However, it feels too complicated for a printerless person to do this offline, then there's the thing with ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ², and I'd also like to be able to do it more than once.

Finally, deeply contemplating, I figured that there might be others out there who would enjoy such a tool - so: a webtool it shall be!
